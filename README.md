## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seatle Airbnb data to better understand:

1. Most popular neighbourhoods
2. Busiest time of the year
3. Price Prediction
4. Reviews Prediction

The full set of files related to this course are owned by Kaggle, so they are not publicly available here.  

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This dataset is part of Airbnb Inside, and the data source can be found here. (https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data)

There are 3 subsets in the dataset:

calendar.csv contains the pricing for each listing id by dates.
listings.csv provides a detailed description of each listing id, such as host and review scores.
reviews.csv gives detailed reviews per listing id.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@rociomm/airbnb-seattle-performance-45bc180e88a2).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb Seatle for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).
